## Release rules
- Never reorder or rename an already-applied migration.
- Never edit an applied migration to change production behavior; add a new migration.
- Every RPC that changes business state must derive authoritative values server-side.
- Client-provided status, quote, verification result, confidence, payout or settlement values are untrusted.
- Demo mode must never write to live settlement/payment systems.
- Payment remains intentionally simulated/not integrated for this release.
- Before a production release, record the Supabase migration status and run the RLS/integrity test suite.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] All 23 migrations are present in the repository.
- [ ] Supabase migration history matches this order.
- [ ] RLS is enabled on every tenant/business table.
- [ ] Role escalation is blocked.
- [ ] Arbitrary client booking writes are blocked.
- [ ] Field ownership/tampering is blocked.
- [ ] Evidence storage and evidence rows enforce operator/job ownership.
- [ ] Verification is restricted to authorized verifiers.
- [ ] Residue pooling requires verified residue.
- [ ] Trigger-only functions cannot be called directly.
- [ ] Payment endpoints remain explicit no-money-movement boundaries.

## Known external dependencies
Cadastral/Khasra geometry, operator telemetry, evidence storage, weather, dispatch optimization, buyer/offtake integrations and messaging providers may depend on external services. Their availability must never be represented as verified field facts when unavailable.
