<p align="center"><b>Field → service → evidence → residue → buyer</b><br>Farmer-first coordination for crop-residue management.</p>

> **Truth boundary:** NIRDHOOM is a prototype / integration foundation. Demo records, indicative quotes, heuristic dispatch, research figures and illustrative carbon/market views are labelled and must not be represented as live field outcomes or confirmed commercial commitments.

## Why this repository is different

NIRDHOOM treats residue management as an operational chain rather than a single dashboard: a field needs consent, a service request needs a verified quote, a machine assignment needs capacity, completed work needs evidence, and residue needs verification before it enters a buyer pathway.

### Product map

| Surface | Purpose | Loading strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Home / Field view** | Farmer-first starting point and today's work | Initial bundle |
| **My Fields / Booking** | Field records, consent and clearance request | Lazy + interaction prefetch |
| **Track / Operator** | Map, machine workflow and evidence | Lazy; Leaflet deferred |
| **Residue Market** | Verified lots, pooling and buyer demand | Lazy + prefetch |
| **Impact / Research** | Evidence, methodology and context | Lazy + prefetch |
| **Advanced** | 3D, AI, carbon and pitch surfaces | Lazy; heavy dependencies isolated |

### Performance principles

- Heavy workspaces use React `lazy()` + `Suspense` instead of shipping every screen up front.
- Leaflet is deferred until Tracking is opened; Three.js stays behind the 3D workspaces.
- Primary navigation uses React transitions so the current screen remains responsive while the next workspace loads.
- Frequently reached workspaces begin loading on pointer/focus intent, reducing perceived navigation latency.
- Images use native lazy loading and asynchronous decoding outside the primary hero.
- Mobile removes expensive backdrop blur and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Production builds use Vite's optimized asset pipeline with CSS code splitting.

  <b>Field → service → evidence → residue → buyer</b><br>
  A farmer-first platform concept for coordinating crop-residue management.
</p>

NIRDHOOM (also referred to in the project materials as **Parali: The Reframe**) is a field-first web application for coordinating farmers, field records, machinery operators, dispatch, verification, and residue offtake. The V7 direction prioritizes the operational chain over adding more dashboard surfaces.

> **Project status:** prototype / integration foundation. This repository is not evidence of an operating service or a completed field pilot. Demo records, indicative quotes, heuristic dispatch, and payment UI must not be represented as live operations, confirmed service commitments, or verified outcomes.


## Connected backend

The dedicated NIRDHOOM Supabase project and deployed database state are documented in [`docs/CONNECTED-SUPABASE.md`](docs/CONNECTED-SUPABASE.md). Payments remain deliberately non-live in the current release scope.

## Competition readiness

NIRDHOOM is prepared for two different competition stories without changing the underlying product:

- **RIDE Hack '26:** startup/incubation story — asset-light rural logistics, machinery coordination, verification, market validation and a supervised pilot path.
- **WarriorHacks 2.0:** community-impact story — a simple farmer workflow that makes crop-residue clearance easier to request, track and verify.

Open **More → Competition Pitch** inside the app for the judge-facing demo route and truth labels.

Submission briefs:
- [RIDE Hack '26 submission](docs/RIDE-HACK-26-SUBMISSION.md)
- [WarriorHacks 2.0 submission](docs/WARRIORHACKS-2-SUBMISSION.md)
- [Competition readiness checklist](docs/COMPETITION-READINESS.md)

**WarriorHacks eligibility note:** the repository has development history predating the current event window. The public event page confirms the Hackathon requires code, a GitHub repository, a 2–3 minute demo and project images, but this repository does not assume that pre-existing work is eligible. Confirm the organizer's rule before submitting and never misrepresent development history.

## What the product is intended to do

NIRDHOOM is designed around the practical steps involved in managing crop residue, rather than treating residue management as a single map or dashboard problem.

- **Farmers:** register or select a field, understand available management pathways, request service, and track a booking.
- **Operators:** receive assigned work, report job progress, and attach field evidence.
- **Dispatchers:** review work and machinery capacity, assign jobs, and handle exceptions.
- **Verifiers:** review evidence and record a traceable decision.
- **Residue buyers / network partners:** express demand and coordinate collection or offtake, subject to verified commercial terms.

The intended chain is:

`Field → consent → quote → booking → dispatch → operator GPS/evidence → verified residue lot → buyer demand/pool → offtake → verification/impact`

This is a target workflow, not a claim that every step is currently connected to a live provider or field operation.

## Current implementation

The repository currently contains the following product surfaces and foundations:

| Area | Present in repository | Important qualification |
|---|---|---|
| Farmer experience | Field view, booking flow, timeline, weather/context and residue pathways | Data may be demo or indicative; live service capacity is not established |
| Field mapping | OpenStreetMap basemap and field-boundary drawing prototype | A drawn polygon is not authoritative cadastral/Khasra geometry |
| Operator workflow | Assigned jobs, device GPS telemetry, private evidence upload, SHA-256 hashing and offline evidence queue | Live provider/RLS behavior still requires field-pilot validation |
| Dispatch | Authenticated `/api/dispatch` + vehicle-specific OR-Tools service + local heuristic fallback | Solver output still requires human review before execution |
| Verification | Evidence and remote-sensing audit model | Satellite signals are supporting evidence, not field-level proof by themselves |
| Residue network | Verified-lot deal pools, buyer demand, offers and related schema/UI | Buyer demand is not a contract until commercial terms are executed |
| Sathi assistant | Assistant UI and server route | Provider-backed and authenticated field context depend on configuration |
| Supabase | SQL migrations, roles, RLS policies and RPC foundations | Must be tested on a dedicated NIRDHOOM project before real data is used |
| PWA | Manifest, service worker and app-shell foundation | Not proof of complete offline transaction synchronization |
| Payments | Demo-only payment surface / ledger concepts | **Real payment or payout integration is explicitly out of scope** |

The implementation and pilot gates are tracked separately so that a UI or schema should not be mistaken for an operationally verified capability.

## Workflow and architecture

### Application entry points

- The active browser application is launched from `index.html` and `src/main.jsx`.
- `src/main.jsx` mounts the modular `src/App.tsx`; the duplicate `src/main.tsx` entrypoint has been removed.
- API routes live under `api/`.
- Database migrations live under `supabase/migrations/`.
- The Python dispatch service foundation lives under `services/dispatch-ortools/`.

### High-level request flow

1. The browser renders the Vite/React application.
2. The user interacts with the relevant product surface.
3. Supabase is the intended persistence/authentication layer for configured features.
4. Server routes under `api/` mediate selected external services and privileged operations.
5. Evidence, status changes, and verification should remain attributable to an actor and timestamp.
6. Operational claims should be derived from auditable records—not from static demo cards or public state-level statistics.

### Trust boundaries

- Browser environment variables must contain only browser-safe values.
- Supabase service-role keys, AI keys, and other provider secrets belong only in server-side environment configuration.
- Role assignment must be performed through an authorized process; a user must not be able to grant themselves privileged access.
- Treat external service output as untrusted input and validate it before it changes operational state.
- Keep farmer data, evidence objects, and authenticated API responses private; avoid indiscriminate caching.

## Research findings and product implications

Research is maintained in the repository so that product assumptions can be reviewed against dated public evidence. The figures below are **context only**; they are not NIRDHOOM performance, live inventory, or forecasts.

### Punjab paddy-season fire counts

The CAQM/PIB season-end release reports the following Punjab fire-event counts for the **15 September–30 November** monitoring window:

| Season | Reported fire-event count |
|---|---:|
| 2021 | 71,304 |
| 2022 | 49,922 |
| 2023 | 36,663 |
| 2024 | 10,909 |
| 2025 | 5,114 |

The 2025 release describes the count as 53% lower than 2024. These are protocol-based fire-event counts for a specified season window; they are not tonnes of residue burned, proof of field-level service coverage, or outcomes attributable to NIRDHOOM. See the [CAQM/PIB season-end release](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2197201&lang=1&reg=3).

### Machinery and service capacity

A September 2026 *Indian Express* report described Punjab's plan for approximately **1.25 lakh operational CRM machines** for the season and discussed ageing equipment. This is a reported preparedness plan, not a live inventory and not evidence that a particular machine is available for a booking. The product therefore needs separate machine states such as registered, operational, available, assigned, and unavailable—with timestamps and a source. See the [September 2026 report](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/record-paddy-area-ageing-crm-fleet-punjab-readies-1-25-lakh-machines-for-stubble-season-10888644/).

### In-situ and ex-situ pathways

Government crop-residue guidance distinguishes in-situ management (retaining, incorporating, mulching, or decomposing residue in the field) from ex-situ management (baling and transporting residue for use elsewhere). The guidance describes a need to match options with locally appropriate solutions and supply-chain infrastructure. This supports keeping in-field operations distinct from collection, storage, transport, and buyer acceptance in the product model. See the [Crop Residue Management Operational Guidelines 2024](https://agrimachinery.nic.in/Files/Guidelines/Guidelines_CRM2024.pdf).

### Remote sensing is one evidence layer

Government reporting describes operational satellite detection of active fire locations and assessment of burn scars under a defined protocol. A satellite observation should therefore be stored with its source, observation time, geometry, and limitations. A missing detection does **not** establish that no burning occurred, and a fire point alone does not establish that a specific field was responsible. See the [PIB parliamentary reply on detection of stubble burning, 5 February 2026](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2223752&lang=2&reg=48).

### What the research means for the product

1. **Availability is a time-bound operational fact.** Do not infer it from total machine counts.
2. **A guaranteed date requires a real capacity reservation.** A displayed estimate is not a service guarantee.
3. **In-situ and ex-situ services have different logistics.** Ex-situ workflows need handling, storage, transport, quality, and buyer acceptance.
4. **Verification must be layered.** Field-boundary provenance, operator evidence, GPS metadata, satellite observations, and human review answer different questions.
5. **Impact metrics need a denominator and period.** Public state-level changes must not be attributed to the product.
6. **Commercial pathways require real counterparties.** A buyer listing is not a contract, and a residue lot is not sold until quantity, quality, price, delivery, and acceptance terms are established.

More detailed source notes, caveats, and refresh guidance are in [docs/PUNJAB-CROP-RESIDUE-RESEARCH.md](docs/PUNJAB-CROP-RESIDUE-RESEARCH.md) and [docs/RESEARCH-DATA.md](docs/RESEARCH-DATA.md).

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- npm
- Git

### Install and start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coolbandariya/nihdhoom.git
cd nihdhoom
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local development URL in the terminal.

### Available scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite development server |
| `npm run build` | Create the production frontend build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the built frontend locally |
| `npm run audit` | Run the repository's static validation/audit script |
| `npm run syntaxcheck` | Run the TypeScript project build check |
| `npm test` | Run Node test files matching `tests/*.test.mjs` |

A command existing in `package.json` does not mean its tests have passed. Run the commands against your current checkout and inspect the results.

## Environment configuration

Start from the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
```

Configure only the values needed for the feature you are testing.

| Variable | Where it belongs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Browser build | URL of the dedicated NIRDHOOM Supabase project |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Browser build | Browser-safe publishable/anon key only |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Server only | Optional provider-backed Sathi; never expose to browser |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server only | Privileged server operations only; never expose to browser |
| `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` | Server only | NASA FIRMS integration credential, if enabled |
| `REQUIRE_AUTH_FOR_FIRMS` | Server only | Set to `true` when requiring authenticated access |
| `DISPATCH_SERVICE_URL` | Server only | URL of a separately deployed dispatch service, if configured |
| IVR variables | Server only | Configure only after provider setup and consent flow are verified; Telegram is the primary farmer channel |

See `.env.example` for the repository's current variable names. Never commit `.env.local`, tokens, private keys, or real farmer data.

## Database setup

**Do not point this repository at an unrelated Supabase project.** Create a dedicated NIRDHOOM project and verify its project URL before applying migrations.

Apply migrations in chronological order:

Apply every migration in `supabase/migrations/` in filename order, including the booking/verification/security migrations and the residue-pooling migrations. Do not skip the later security migrations.

Then configure the required authentication and storage settings documented by the migrations. Use `supabase/seed.sql` only for an explicitly identified demo environment.

Before using real records, verify migrations on a fresh project and test RLS with separate accounts for each role. Do not treat successful SQL application alone as proof of correct authorization.

## Validation and tests

Run the repository checks:

```bash
npm install
npm run syntaxcheck
npm run audit
npm test
npm run build
```

The Python dispatch service also has a unit-test suite and should be checked with `python -m unittest test_main.py -v` after installing `services/dispatch-ortools/requirements.txt`.

The current release deliberately does not include a browser E2E harness.

The Python dispatch service also has a syntax check:

```bash
python -m compileall -q services/dispatch-ortools
```

For a release, record the commit SHA and CI run, and verify that all required checks completed successfully. A static audit or successful frontend build does not replace RLS, provider, device, or field-pilot tests.

## Deployment notes

The intended frontend deployment target is Vercel, but deployment should happen only after the production build and release checks pass.

1. Create and verify the dedicated NIRDHOOM Supabase project.
2. Apply and test migrations in order.
3. Configure environment variables separately for preview and production.
4. Deploy the frontend and required server routes.
5. Deploy the dispatch service separately if the application is configured to call it.
6. Test authentication, booking, field-scoped access, evidence handling, and failure states in the deployed environment.
7. Keep demo data disabled or visibly labelled in any public deployment.

Do not assume that a Vercel deployment automatically deploys the Python dispatch service or configures Supabase providers.

## Known limitations and release boundary

The repository is a prototype/integration foundation. The following still require implementation, configuration, or verification before a controlled pilot:

- Real phone OTP onboarding and consent capture are implemented; consent withdrawal is now self-service. Real deployed-provider verification is still required.
- Authoritative cadastral/Khasra boundary source and field-level provenance.
- Production GPS/device validation remains a pilot gate; the operator UI now surfaces stale readings.
- Private evidence upload, server-side content validation, and trusted hashing.
- Dispatch service deployment and validation of returned assignments.
- Real service-area capacity, booking concurrency, cancellation, and escalation rules.
- Buyer identity, binding offers/contracts, lot quality, custody, and acceptance workflow.
- Remote-sensing ingestion and human verification/appeal workflow.
- Reliable offline queue synchronization on real devices.
- API rate limits, request validation, observability, alerting, backups, and retention.
- Live Supabase records are now read by the app when demo mode is disabled; write workflows still require the authenticated RPC/operator paths and must be validated against the deployed project.
- Accessibility and low-end Android field testing.
- Production privacy policy, terms, consent records, and operational support procedures.

### Payment scope

**Real payment/payout integration is intentionally excluded from the current scope.** Payment screens or ledger concepts are demonstration-only. Do not add provider credentials or describe a UI action as settlement. See [docs/NON-PAYMENT-RELEASE-SCOPE.md](docs/NON-PAYMENT-RELEASE-SCOPE.md) and [docs/CONTROLLED-PILOT-RUNBOOK.md](docs/CONTROLLED-PILOT-RUNBOOK.md).

### Pilot readiness

Use [docs/FINAL-PILOT-READINESS.md](docs/FINAL-PILOT-READINESS.md) as the detailed checklist. A checkbox should be marked complete only when supported by a test result, environment verification, or operational sign-off.

**Research limitations:** Public figures may be estimates, plans, or protocol-specific observations. Always preserve geography, measurement period, publication date, and source. Do not infer district-level availability or attribute state-level changes to NIRDHOOM. Recheck time-sensitive figures before using them in a live product.

## Contributing

1. Create a branch for a focused change.
2. Keep demo and live data paths clearly separated.
3. Do not add secrets or identifiable farmer data to commits, screenshots, fixtures, or logs.
4. Update the relevant research or operational documentation when changing a product assumption.
5. Run the applicable checks and report any that could not be run.
6. For schema changes, include migration and authorization tests; do not silently edit an already-applied migration in a deployed environment.

---

**Project principle:** Make the field-to-residue chain traceable, keep claims proportional to evidence, and distinguish a working prototype from a verified service.
